        Hi! You might not be aware of this (or maybe you were totally aware but you totally forgot - that has happened at least once!), but /r/GamerGhazi has recently added some new [posting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/2yzcus/announcing_our_new_rules/) in order to reduce the number of low-effort posts. As such, links to Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube must be submitted as self-posts, along with a short paragraph explaining why you found your link to be relevant to the topic of gaming and diversity. 
        
        In addition, we have additional guidelines regarding Reddit and Twitter links:
        
        * links to Reddit posts must have at least ten comments
        * links to Reddit comments must have at least 10 upvotes or -10 downvotes
        * Twitter links must have over 10 favs or 10 retweets.
        
        Please ensure that your link follows the above guidelines before resubmitting as a self-text. Thanks!

        The above link needs to be verified to ensure this is not a Tweet or Reddit comment/post. If this is a Tweet or Reddit comment/post, please leave a comment letting them know about our posting guidelines.

        Hi! Unfortunately, your link(s) to Reddit is not a no-participation (i.e. http://np.reddit.com or https://np.reddit.com) link. We require all links to Reddit to be non-participation links to help mitgate brigading. Because of this, this {{kind}} has been removed. Please feel free to edit this with the required non-participation link(s); once you do so, we can approve the post immediately. 

        (You can easily do this by replacing the 'www' part with 'np' in the URL. Make sure you keep the http:// or https:// part!)
        
        Note: as part of my programming, a mod message regarding this removal has been sent to the moderators here, so there's no need to message us!
    modmail_subject: non-participation link 
    modmail: |
        {{permalink}}
        
        This submission by /u/{{author}} will need to be approved if and when the user changes the links to np. Heads up.

        You screwed up your np-link. No particpation links are `np.reddit.com`, not `np.www.reddit.com` or `www.np.reddit.com`. The latter two tend to piss off browsers. Please fix this so that a moderator can reapprove it.

        We're sorry, but [we've discontinued the use of off-topic tags](http://www.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/2yzcus/announcing_our_new_rules/). Because titles cannot be edited, your submission has been removed. Please resubmit this without the off-topic tag. If you're not sure whether your submission fits the topic of gaming and diversity, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGamerGhazi).
